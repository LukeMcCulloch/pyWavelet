# pyWavelet
Python conversion of "Wavelets for computer graphics: theory and applications" by Anthony D. DeRose, David Salesin, and Eric J. Stollnitz

This conversion was originally done as part of my PhD, in order to better understand wavelets.  See that code base for a wavelet-hierarchical B-spline implemenation including multilevel optimizing solver facilitating local detail inclusion during automated design.
